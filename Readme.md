# Information:

Tritium preset system:
Presets are actually portable with this tool. Presets are accessible in:
ATC/configs/
They will be .bat files containing RGB variables.

Specular system:
The specular that will be used to generate the games specular intensity is in:
nzhspc/blank.png
You can share this .png file with anyone and as long as they put it in their nzhspc folder
with the name blank.png, they will be able to use your specular that you generated.
